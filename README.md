# rigorouszeroes
This repository provides a Python implementation of a number of tools and methods necessary to compute rigorous enclosures of zeroes of analytic functions. The algorithm implemented was originally presented by T. Johnson and W. Tucker in Enclosing all zeros of an analytic function â€” A rigorous approach. The materials prepared here were part of a final deliverable for Prof. Serrano-Gomez's MAT 983 section in Spring 2016, a seminar on validated numerics at Princeton University.
